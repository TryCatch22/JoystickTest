JoystickTest
============

An XNA project to help test and debug gamepads. The main use is visualizing joystick bounding box, range and accuracy, particularly when using different deadzone modes.

Also includes a project that allows for DirectInput gamepad/joystick support, since XNA by default only supports XInput (i.e. Xbox360-like) gamepads.
